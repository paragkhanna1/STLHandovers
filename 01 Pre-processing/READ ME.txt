Pre-Processes data from “A multimodal data set of human handovers with design implications for human-robot handovers,” P. Khanna, M. Björkman, and C. Smith, https://github.com/KTH-RPL/handovers_dataset; 
Pre-processing is described in depth in Section 3.2.1 in the Thesis.

We consider the signals of giver right hand, taker right hand, baton. Possition, velocity and acceleration are estimated using a user tuned Kalman filter. Coordinates are given in a shared frame of reference, based around the centerpoint between the chests of giver and taker. Handovers are trimmed to start at the beginning of the reach phase of the handover, and end at the end of the transfer phase. Signals are padded to the same length; possition signals hold the final value; velocity and acceleration are zero-padded.
Outliers are removed by a threshold on deviation from mean signal. Tracking errors are also detected and removed. Handovers can be removed manually if needed.

Output is two folders containing Learning and Validation datasets; these are ready to use to Extract STL-specification. Datasets contain .csv files, each containing signals from one handover. Each .csv file contains a time column starting at 0, and 18 data columns (giver/taker right hands, x/y/z, position/velocity/acceleration).
Units given in:
time - s
Position - m
Velocity - m/s
Acceleration - m/s^2



How to use:
All parameters are available in "%% Set parameters". Code outside this section should not need editing.

Before running the input dataset must be downloaded (https://github.com/KTH-RPL/handovers_dataset) and location for must be set in INPUT_DATASET.folders. 
Output datasets are placed in new folders in the current matlab folder.

Set locations:
* INPUT_DATASET.folders (list of strings); set to the destination of desired handover data, formated as in “A multimodal data set of human handovers with design implications for human-robot handovers,” P. Khanna, M. Björkman, and C. Smith, https://github.com/KTH-RPL/handovers_dataset. Each folder should contain subfolders "handover_[number]", in turn containing .csv files for each handover in that set.
* INPUT_DATASET.name (list of strings); set names for each folder above. ex. "P1_S2" - pair1 Set2

* LEARNING_DATA_FILEPATH.folder (String); Destination folder of output dataset of Learning data; end with "\"
* VALIDATION_DATA_FILEPATH.folder (String); Destination folder of output dataset of Learning data; end with "\"
* MAT_DATASET.filename (String); Destination and filename of the dataset saved as .mat


Tunable parameters are available in "%% Set parameters". Default values were used were used in the thesis. See comments for explenations.

LEARNING_TO_VALIDATION_RATIO = 0.2; 	% Set ratio of learning data to validation data, I used 0.2 in my thesis for 80% learning data, 20% validation data

% Outlier detection settings
OUTLIER_SETTINGS.Start_t = -2;      % Start time for relevant data
OUTLIER_SETTINGS.End_t = 2;         % End time for relevant data
OUTLIER_SETTINGS.std_tol = 2.5;     % Signal must not deviate from the mean...
OUTLIER_SETTINGS.samples_tol = 40;  % for more than this many samples

% Pickup zone detection setting
    % Pickup zone is a radius around the location of giver_right_hand 
    % when they first grab the object. Handover starts when 
    % giver_right_hand moves out from the pickup zone.
PICKUP_ZONE_RADIUS = 0.1;           % Radius of pickup zone 
    
% Object ownership settings
OWNERSHIP.grip_threshold = 1;       % Force threshold detecting when giver/taker is holding the object (Newtons)

% Downsample
DOWNSAMPLE.downsample_factor = 5;   % Determines sample rate of output data
    % Input sample rate (120Hz) / downsample_factor = Output samle rate

% Filtering settings
    % Estimates position, velocity and acceleration using tuned kalman filter, 
    % And removes handovers with tracking error above threshold.
SMOOTHING_SETTINGS.error_threshold = 0.08   % Max tracking error (Meter)
SMOOTHING_SETTINGS.kalman_alpha = 50        % Kalman filter tuning parameter




To specify handovers to manually remove; use function "remove_handover()" in section "%% Manually remove problem signals"
