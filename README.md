# STLHandovers
Repository containing learnt STL specificaitons of handovers from a human-handovers dataset. Also has the code-set for a handover planner based on these specifications.

The specifications used for the associated article can be seen in "STL_specification_(90%)_used.txt"

The results folders contain participant wise human-to-robot experimentation results that were used to validate the robot controller based on the handover planner. Each participant did 5 handovers each.

Updated Folder wise : 
'01 Pre-processing': Code for Pre Processing the data
'02 Extract STL-model': Codeset for STL inferenece and extracting the STL based model (STL specifications)  
'03 STL-based planner': Codeset to create and test STL based planner from STL model (specifications)
